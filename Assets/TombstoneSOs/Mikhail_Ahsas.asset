  notebook: "Mikhail was a veteran mercenary working for a demolition company. The
    cold and howling wind of Russia forged his iron will and the almost morbid love
    of sandwich. Even when on the battlefield, he would bring his sandwich lunchbox
    ready to eat. It was a sunny day when the man was stabbed from the back by one
    of his \u201Ccolleagues\u201D who turned out to be a disguise of an enemy spy.
    He could not finish the last bite of his sandwich."
