  quotes: -Courageous Actor and Stuntman-
  hereLies: '"If you have to cope with many problems, its either you end up sinking
    or you end up swimming"'
  notebook: Despite his bizarre name, Chesnut was a prolific actor in Hollywood,
    despite his young age, his debut film from 1999, "The Body Snatchers From Outer
    Space," made millions and more at the box office and was his breakout film for
    his career. Chesnut had a unique acting method, where he chose to do many of
    the stunts himself rather than hiring a stuntman. However, with his most recent
    film, a set of defibrillators weren't checked to be off before shooting, causing
    him to have a heart attack. Unfortunately, they couldn't hook up the defibrillators
    in time to revive him, leaving him dead on set with the only means of saving
    him out of energy.
