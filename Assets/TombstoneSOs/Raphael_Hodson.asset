  notebook: A safety inspector was doing his final rounds of a new construction site,
    after marking down a few minor safety concerns he clocked out and began the walk
    back to his truck. While distracted making a joke to a coworker he fell down
    a several story deep hole. It seems things were not very safe that day for the
    safety inspector.
