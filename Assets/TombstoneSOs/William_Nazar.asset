  notebook: Nazar was a prolific CEO and head of a massive toy conglomerate, one
    day, he visited one of his factories in order to oversee special toy construction,
    the toy was designed to be "The happiest toy ever," and designed by Nazar. However,
    the design of the toy used an incredibly toxic chemical, Nazar unfortunately
    inhaled a lot of the chemical, dropping dead almost instantly on the factory
    floor. At least he died with the knowledge that his toy finished production.
