  notebook: As a full time employee at a brick and mortar store, she had a very lukewarm
    time working as a janitor. She was called to go handle a spill in the dairy section,
    in a bad mood already from previous customers, she moved over there in a huff
    and had to deal with a massive almond milk spill. In her fury, she swung her
    mop in the wrong direction, causing her to lose her balance and fall face first
    against the ground, her head hitting the ground forehead first, knocking her
    out, she drowned in the milk in her unconscious state before anyone found her.
